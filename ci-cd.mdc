# Pipeline Structure
- Separate jobs for build, test, lint, and deploy.
- Lint and tests must pass before build artifacts are created (fail fast).

# Security
- Integrate SAST (e.g., Snyk, GitHub CodeQL) and dependency scanning in CI.
- Fail pipeline if critical vulnerabilities are detected.

# Verification
- Confirm pipeline fails on lint or test errors.
- Ensure security scan reports are generated and reviewed.

# Example (GitHub Actions)
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: make lint
  test:
    needs: lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: make test

- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- run: make test

# Verification Steps
- Confirm pipeline fails on lint or test errors.
- Ensure security scan reports are generated and reviewed.
