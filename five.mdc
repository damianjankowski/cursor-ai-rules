# When to Use
- Use this rule when asked to perform root cause analysis or investigate a problem.

# Steps
1. Clearly define the problem or symptom.
2. Ask "Why?" up to five times, drilling down to the root cause.
3. Validate the logical chain; check if addressing the root cause prevents recurrence.
4. Develop solutions that address the root cause, not just symptoms.
5. Document the analysis and involve relevant stakeholders.

# Example
**Problem:** Application crashes when processing large files
1. Why? → The application runs out of memory
2. Why? → It loads entire file into memory at once
3. Why? → The file parser wasn't designed for streaming
4. Why? → Initial requirements only specified small files
5. Why? → Requirements gathering didn't consider future growth
**Root Cause:** Incomplete requirements gathering
**Solution:** Implement streaming parser and improve requirements process
