# Secure Configuration
- Never hardcode secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) in source code.
- Load secrets from environment variables or secret managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault).
- Ensure `.env` files containing secrets are not committed (see @.gitignore).
- Example (Python):
  import os
  db_password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
- Example (Terraform):
  variable "db_password" {
    type = string
    sensitive = true
  }

# Encryption & Transport
- Enforce TLS for all external communications (e.g., database, APIs).
- Use client libraries with built-in TLS verification; never disable certificate checks.

# Verification
- Search for `password =` or `token =` in code and ensure usage of env vars.
- Confirm `.env` is in `.gitignore` and no `.env` files are tracked.
